 A Conversational Robot for Physical distancing awareness and threat warning system.

We, humans, tend to forget important points as time passes by. The only way to be consistent about something is to have something to remind us about the same until it becomes a habit for us. It is fundamentally not possible to stay under home quarantine for a long time.
People need to start working at one point, even if COVID doesn’t seem to have an end. But, this must not be implemented without any measures.

● Should maintain distancing at least for another year

● COVID-19 may spread again, if not taken care of.

● Post corona life is expected to be different from normal life.

With regard to all these parameters, an apt system which can assist humans when in need and remind them about the protective measures that must be followed at all times and warn them if the same is not followed. In this era of emerging technologies, an assistant who can interact with humans to provide COVID related information easily through basic conversation as well as warn them when necessary automatically is a must.

# The main objective of the project:
● To create a Conversational Robot which can interact with people through
Speech (NLP)

● A robot that can warn people when Social Distancing is not maintained - Using openCV and implementing YOLO to train a program to detect if Social Distancing is being followed.

● The concept of sending out a mini Robot which can travel to that designated place and read out a warning to them to follow Social
Distancing 

● Training the Robot using Dialog Flow to reply to people’s queries and search and give the necessary answer required.

● The trained conversational chatbot is implemented with Google Assistant so that people can converse with the bot to get the necessary information/report something at the ease of their hand.

# Key Deliverables:
● An autonomous conversational robot pre-programmed to help humans with their queries.

● Almost any query related to the COVID pandemic can be conversed.

● The robot can detect humans and see whether social distancing is being followed.

● Robots can take in feedback from humans to improve environmental conditions.

● Humans can report a suspect and the same will be forwarded to the authorities asap.

● Robots can be summoned through Google Assistant on their phones when the robot is not in their vicinity. The GA AI bot can provide essential information about the current COVID status. The suspect report can also be conducted.


# Validity of Concept:
● It is possible with AI to monitor physical distancing using YOLO, a fully convolutional neural network.

● It is also possible to Recognise voice and understand the user query and respond accordingly, as per trained by the developer.

● Integrating these two features onto a Robot structure, with necessary embedded systems, for movement of the bot, can serve in the places such as entrances, etc.
